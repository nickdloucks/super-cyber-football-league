# Super Cyber Football League

The SCFL is an imaginary football league I created as a kid. I made teams of sock puppets that would play each other using dice to determine the outcome of each play. The best teams would meet in the Sock Bowl to determine a champion! Now, I am developing an app that will simulate these football games, keep track of scoring, statistics, standings, and more. 

Users will be able to follow each game with an interface inspired by ESPN Gamecast. It will update each team's stats and the game-simulator program will determine a winner. Standings tables will keep track of how well each team is doing during the regular season, and the best teams will be picked by their record to be invited to the playoffs (where Sock Football glory awaits!).

As more games are played, I will write articles about the biggest games and post them in a News/articles section.

This SCFL app will use the MERN stack with Typescript.
