# Super Cyber Football League

The SCFL is an imaginary football league I created as a kid. I made teams of sock puppets that would play each other using dice to determine the outcome of each play. The best teams would meet in the Sock Bowl to determine a champion! Now, I am developing an app that will simulate these football games, keep track of scoring, statistics, standings, and more. 

Users will be able to follow each game with an interface inspired by ESPN Gamecast. It will update each teams' stats and determine a winner. Standings tables will keep track of how well each team is doing during the regular season, and the best teams will be picked by their record to be invited to the playoffs (where Sock Football glory awaits!).

As more games are played, I will write articles about the biggest games and post them in a News/articles section.

------------------
This SCFL app will use the MERN stack with Typescript.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
